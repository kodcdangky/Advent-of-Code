- Find all scanners directly intersecting with scanner 0
- Merge all non-sharing beacons from these scanners into scanner 0
- Find all scanners directly intersecting with the expanded scanner 0
- Merge
- Repeat till all non-0 scanners are merged with scanner 0
- Number of beacons on scanner 0 = Total number of beacons



-- Finding intersecting scanners:   # time cost go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr esp for non-intersecting scanners
- Blind reorient each scanner
- With each reorientation, search for intersection
- If >= 12 intersecting beacons --> correct orientation
- If <12 intersecting beacons with all 24 orientations --> not intersecting (yet)


-- Merge non-sharing beacons:
- Have correct orientation from finding intersection --> find absolute scanner location
- Just add lol
